"bug: new updates in-lesson streak UI, green Bolt, duo jumping etc, make it impossible to re listen to the lesson, or click on a word to rehear after the lesson. Also have to completly close out of the APP when i open it, cause its just a blank screen on first open, minimizing the APP now kicks me out of the lesson, ... welcome to our scrappy AI overlords. holy bugs. From 10 am to 10pm regained 0 hearts (due to the reopen it into blank screen and force closing it and restart the app). Nice stuff",1,2025-08-16 22:40:54

"please don't immediately stop the speaking lessons just because you can understand what I am saying. I want to try again. don't go to ""let's try again in another 15 minutes"". I want to try it again immediately. I thought that's how we should learn, try again when we fails. are you mocked me thinks I'm giving up just because I fail once? I know this review will never be read by Duolingo. just like any other company that think rating are just a promotion tactics and unnecessary to them.",1,2025-08-15 20:11:03
"Indonesia → English, pas unit 1 bagus, tapi pas unit 2 chapter 15 seterusnya pentunjuk banyak banget yang ngawur,salah total, ilang. tolong diperbaiki lah. niatnya mau belajar eh pas lupa terus petunjuknya ilang kan jadi terpaksa harus salah. alhasil harus nonton iklan buat nambahin hatinya, cuma gara² kesalahan gini, buang² waktu banget.",1,2025-08-15 17:22:33

i lowkey hate this app im currently on a 774 day streak and I hate every day of it. i havent learned the language in fact this app makes you think you are learning it when you are far better off reading a book and writing a personal vocabulary from it. but this app makes you avoid working giving you the impression you are doing something anyway. the only reason i havent uninstalled it is because i am addicted to big numbers OH did i mention the company fired all their employees for an AI,1,2025-08-11 23:17:50
"I gave up on polish because of this app, it expected me to know all the grammar rules. For japanese however, it explains everything perfectly before a lesson starts when introducing new factors to the language's grammar. I just wish we could learn more kanji than 一、二、 and 三 considering I'm on unit 2. vocaloids songs taught me more japanese to be honest, but this app helps with the grammar and I like the way it teaches hiragana, katakana, and kanji. どうもありがとう。 edit: I found the issue on the kanji-",4,2025-08-11 01:03:37

"In general good app to start learning a language but experience on Android app is terrible for some time now. The rewards and XP system sometimes is working sontimes not, listening lessons get randomly disabled, missing translations, no option to rearrange words in word bank exercises (on iOS it's possible). Once my premium ends I'm done with this app.",1,2025-08-07 00:15:07
"I tried this app for a few months, and ultimately learnt nothing but a few words like how to say cat. The app never reinforced those lessons. I recently went back on my courses, and found i didn't understand most, or guessed my answer based on the buttons. Furthermore, i cannot in any way support being AI first, replacing human written courses by AI slop. I wanted to learn, but ended up just wasting time, and making a fool of myself when trying to use said language in any amount.",1,2025-08-06 20:34:27
Duolingo is useless as a free app with its new energy system. They've basically said leave or pay up.,1,2025-08-05 23:31:35
"Low quality app that doesn't actually help with language learning, just yet another annoying app with streaks and micro transactions, and especially after they announced that the company would be AI first, it'd probably be better to learn by talking to a brick wall. Try watching kids shows in the language you wanna learn instead, way more effective, and also relatively free.",1,2025-08-05 20:27:32
"Not good at teaching languages, FIRED employees just to implement AI, I hate how worse it got since then, and the worst thing that just appeared is ""energy "" intead of hearts which I despise. The pronunciation is kinda bad because they dont have humans actually talking, just bad ai voices, the lessons became longer; my boyfriend was doing my mother tongue and the sentences were absolute trash/incorrect, also very pushy ab rating so here you have it. I'll stop using the app, it's gotten so bad",1,2025-08-04 23:28:53
"I like the app, learning Japanese with it pretty well. Unfortunately the trial period could not be activated for me, the support could not confirm if I have a subscription open now, did not address my issue at all and I still cannot use the free trial period for max. #bug",3,2025-08-04 23:01:48

"The Chinese course (and most other courses) are pretty undeveloped so you can't get that far in the language unless it's Spanish Fr*nch German or English. It's fun and somewhat effective but there are things it expects you to know that it doesn't teach you. For example, in the Chinese course (which is the one I'm taking), it doesn't teach you tone rules even though they're really important. Also Duolingo is replacing a ton of workers with Artificial intelligence. But that's all the bad side.",2,2025-07-30 22:56:39

Ever since the newest update it has been glitching out. The sound for the listening lessons is wonky and the speech portion cuts you off before you even finish the second word.,3,2025-07-21 11:34:13

I have been using Duolingo since January of 2023, ever since I met my husband. We are incredibly disappointed with their replacing of human employees for cheap and buggy artificial intelligence.

I can speak fluent English now. I didn't like the ads but I understood their purpose (duolingos mission and to keep their app free for all) This is better than any other app because of the day streaks. With them you can flex to other people that you commited a whole year to Duolingo. much better than flexing something in a video game which won't get you anywhere in life,5,2025-07-21 09:43:04

I've had Duolingo for over a decade and it's really gotten so much worse over the years. where do I start? the forums where people could talk and learn together? gone. being able to understand a mistake? pay walled. and don't get me started on the AI slop. if only the team spent as much time and effort on the actual learning experience as they do on the cringey in-app ads.

It was an ok app to get things started when learning a new language. Being gamified helps out to build habits. But as time went on I kept noticing that the content took a massive nose dive. I felt like I wasn't learning as much as I could've unless I paid for it or devoted more time. I stick with it for over a year and I feel like I've hit a wall. With Duolingo coming out with AI and firing their actual employees I had enough. Hire more linguists along side your precious AI!,1,2025-07-21 08:52:29

App has slowly become more frustrating as the company gets greedier. Every update breaks something or makes the app slower and less responsive. I'm not in the beta why is it so unstable.

"It's good for starters. If you do one lesson a day just to keep your streak, it takes a while to complete a level. It's very repetitive. You just practice the same words and only learn like 4-5 new words each level. Also, the reminders are very annoying. Every week or two, even if you don't continue your streak, you get a reminder. And if you do, it reminds you every day. Also, the voice thing never works, and you just lose a life for it. The ads are also annoying. I recommend this to beginners.",1,2025-07-21 05:32:01

You can no longer practice to replenish lost hearts making learning new material extremely difficult. The app pushes its paid version after every single thing you do. I casually practice when I have time and the app icon on home screen will start to have different looks turning even sick looking and it's so annoying to look at I've had to hide it lol. Unfortunately I don't believe this app is very good for free and casual users anymore.,2,2025-07-21 05:30:09

"It's bad. Since AI, the sentences are weird (the car eats the mouse). A lot of wrong translations. Only north Vietnamese. And the worse, it doesn't explain any grammar, so you have to figure that out yourself. That cost so much time and you make so many errors which you don't understand that it'll take 10 times longer to learn the language. 😭😭😭 Only good to 'improve' your vocabulary with the force to use it daily.

"Greek scoring completely broken - frustrating after huge effort 49,320 XP in Greek with most sections at Legendary status, more than halfway through the 61-unit course = score of only 17.

"How to take the fun out of learning? Penalize the learner for making mistakes. On that front, Duolingo is doing an excellent job. Teaching languages, on the other hand, not so much. Was much better three years ago, when we still had tips and the forum.",1,2025-07-20 22:56:38

"I have used Duolingo for years and my experience has mostly been positive (at least as a super duo subscriber.) More recently, I have found myself upset with the over the top gamification-UX. For example, I really appreciate that I can turn off animations inside the app, but the pushy (and intrusive) app icons - that are meant to reflect game status - makes me upset. Please give us more options to turn off UX features that are ""loud and intrusive.""",3,2025-07-20 22:44:48

Amazing helpful app due to this I can speak Spanish more than before but one thing I will like to recommend is that when you click the button that says I can't speak before you know it it shows a wrong answer while you haven't even given any answer which is frustrating as the fact you lose a heart for that so please work on that because I love this app so much,4,2025-07-20 20:56:53

Dont like leaderboards. Exercises repeat with too much frequency. Edit: units just teach like 1 or 2 things. I often can skip 80% of the unit because it's all repeat repeat repeat. It's like the app thinks you are dumb or something. Translation using the word bank doesn't teach you at all because you can guess the whole sentence. After a 600+ days streak I can tell you that you will learn much better Japanese with Renshuu. Now it also pesters you to update to Max.,1,2025-07-20 20:47:22

The fact that I am here to bear witness the downfall of Duolingo is heartbreaking.

"Honestly, it is one of the best applications of AI out there. Learning a language from a computer is not natural, but the educational scaffolding in DuoLingo is very well designed. Language learning is best done with native speakers, but this is a very close facsimile. To achieve fluency, you will need to use this app for months on end; more practice, more better.

"As a free user, the app is great, but definitely not good or the best. It teaches you SOME basics, but, despite some stuff that could be useful, you CAN'T really hold a conversation with a native speaker of the language that you're learning (Chinese in my case). The grammar isn't really explained, and, in some of my HanZi practice lessons, certain characters that I met are MISSING, along with some other issues I had with this learning app. The AI reading is also terrible. Not so useful app.",3,2025-07-20 18:19:40

Have to say the shrill voice of Junior is super annoying and really grates on my ears giving headaches. There should be an option to pick which voices you hear in your lessons. Because an awful voice makes it harder to return to lessons.,1,2025-07-20 17:14:22

Duolingo isn't helping at learning grammar. They just give a clue that sometimes doesn't help at all. It's really hard if you're not fluent in understanding the foreign language. It's always messed up when grammar lessons come. Still need another app like Ai assistant or kind of website or book to check the grammar.,2,2025-07-20 15:42:23

"Dissatisfied. Danish language learners beware! I would give ""Nul Stjerner"" if I could. Numerous erroneous English translations of Danish texts. It is clear and obvious a native English speaker does NOT proofread translations. I have countless screen shots of poor English grammar and bizzarely imprecise Danish. You are also never instructed on Danish, rather you are only tested. This app is an inferior substitute for a proper class.

मुझे यह बहुत ही पसंद आया क्योंकि इसमें आप अपने मनपसंद इंग्लिश सीख रहे हैं और आप इसमें इंग्लिश से जुड़ी हुई बातों का अनुमान भी लगा रहे हैं हमें पता नहीं था कि यह शब्द भी इंग्लिश में उसे होते हैं और हमें पता नहीं था कि यह उसका उसे कहां करते हैं क्योंकि हमसिर्फ कुछ नही पढ़ रहे थे और यह हम यहां पर दो लिंगो पर सीख रहे हैं रोलिंग में एक बहुत अच्छा ऐप है और देश के लिए बहुत अच्छा ऐप है जिससे चाहिए कि यह आगे चलकर बहुत अच्छा है बने और उसमें बहुत सारी बदलाव की जरूरत नहीं है क्योंकि बच्चे इसी पर सेसीख रहे,5,2025-07-20 15:04:41

"It's been a really convenient, fun, and entertaining way to learn so far. It doesn't even feel like learning a language so much as a progressing puzzle with foreign words. The funny ways that the owl pushes you to learn by notification or widget keeps me going each day even when I'm not in the mood to practice or learn anything. I've studied a lot of different ways and this has been the one that sticks and motivates. I highly recommend it.",5,2025-07-20 14:33:40

"it's fantastic for making learning languages low effort, but I lacks essential features, like allowing you classifying a new word easy or hard. it tries to guess it by your mistake , but exactly because it's fast paced and gameified, 90% of my mistakes are accidental mispresses, etc, so I end up practicing ""banana"". Properly explaining grammar or making sure you learn the alphabet first are also slowing your progress in actual learning.",4,2025-07-20 14:30:15
Che so good and i study English and I'm so good in English i love you duolingo,5,2025-07-20 14:28:34
"I find the lessons are either too long, or in the case of the listening exercises, too short. I don't like the ""5 in a row/10 in a row"" nonsense. I find it annoying.

"I loved this app for a long time, as it made learning fun, turning it into a low pressure game. But they've added more and more ""competitive"" features and things add pressure plus nags that get to a point of detracting from the fun (for me at least). if you do a lot, you get put in more ""competitive"" leagues, which is ok. but eventually the time required just to avoid demotion becomes excessive. Sometimes I wish I'd not renewed my subscription.",3,2025-07-20 14:12:10
"Fantastic language app. However, it's been realesding up lately. It's not allowing me to give the correct answers. Its very frustrating because it's onlynl accepting wrong answer and impose my hearts and cannot finish a game. Also, the Japanese audio has on the most part become so incomprehensible that I lose all my hearts.",4,2025-07-20 14:11:34

"I've been a Super user for almost 3 years. Had to uninstall the app because it became unnecessarily hard. Only 16 users stay in the Diamond league, really? It's crazy because everyone wants to stay. And you have to either earn XP to stay in the league or you actually learn the language. Not to mention that developers removed Duo's best features like the community where you could ask questions to native speakers. It would've been much better for me to spend all this time in Busuu instead.",2,2025-07-20 13:33:17

"I tried learning Spanish for a club in school and showed some of the lessons to my teacher there who pointed out many mistakes. I'm a native German speaker and after that Spanish 'incident' I tried the German course to see how it looks there and was surprised by the amount of mistakes and useless things you learn in the first lessons. Plus, when you report the mistakes nothing happens which is pretty frustrating and you also don't really learn any grammar.",1,2025-07-20 11:24:25

"Honestly this app was probably my favorite language learning app of all time. It's fun, it has memorable characters and stories, it even keeps up with trends and the media. But I have poured two and a half years of my life into this app and I couldn't say I'm anymore fluent then I was back in the 8th Grade when I was taking a Spanish class. With the new AI systems running everything it's practically impossible to learn a new language. I will miss you Duo, thank you.",3,2025-07-20 11:17:43

"endlessly learning the same pointless sentence ""we have a dog?"" ""yes we have a dog"" repeated for 3mintutes. is not learning....it's embarrassing! the ratio of play to learning is 99 to 1. as well as the endless prodding to buy power ups and extra time, the extra cynical thing I've noticed is that the match madness game, won't let you beat the timer when you get to the advanced level of match madness as the buttons you need appear too slowly.😡",1,2025-07-20 11:14:24
"Terrible speech recognition. No way you're telling native speakers their pronunciation is incorrect. Also putting similar words like ""The"" and ""Tea"" in one word bank to make sure we have a bigger chance to make a mistake is quite pathetic.",1,2025-07-20 11:13:35

It's good for learning some extreme basics but it won't teach you the language. It doesn't know the difference between a spelling mistake and a grammar problem so it never teaches you your weaknesses or explains anything at all. Now it's all low quality AI anyway.,2,2025-07-20 09:33:20

"As a 40 something man, the idea of learning a new language was thought of a too difficult, not enough time usual excuses. Not with Duolingo. Now I spend 10-15 minutes per day, following the easy to use lessons, fun games and listening tests you don't really notice you are learning. Swap the time you spend on social media for Duolingo and you will really benefit.",5,2025-07-20 09:08:05

"Update: Getting worse don't waste your time especially if more AI is coming Not great for learning grammar rules. Exercises tend to be repetitive, often times the voice speaking doesn't match up to the word(s). 2nd Update: After recent bad updates it's gotten even worse and will not be renewing anything. Soooo much AI slop.",1,2025-07-20 06:05:45

they do not teach you any useful words or phrases. The lessons take a step change in difficulty that make it almost impossible to continue.,1,2025-07-20 05:58:50

"I should say that this app absolutely works for me, and I've learned French with it, and used to love it. However, recently they started to use AI to generate lessons and it's ridiculous. Not just I have to read through the AI slop of the stories, but the inability of LLMs to understand the flow of the meaning makes some exercises impossible to solve without having to guess, just because you haven't seen the necessary info yet. Please don't be greedy and pay actual people to produce content.",3,2025-07-20 05:55:45

"Every time they incorporate new AI into the app, it ruins the current learner's progress. The new AI version constantly tests you on words it never taught you. It constantly ""makes changes"" to the lesson plan and jumps your progress forward without actually teaching you any of the new stuff, forcing you to start the whole section over. After the last update, if you say ""I can't listen now"" it counts it as a mistake. I'm almost 1500 days in and the app has become unreliable garbage.",1,2025-07-20 05:45:23

"There is no shortcut or games that will propel you to learn and speak the actual language. Learn it the traditional way.

Duolingo provides interesting exercises in a multitude of languages. I sorely regret that Duolingo dropped the chat fora and means for users to provide direct feedback. There it s no personal user support. Also it wouldbe helpful to be able to review exercises after they have been completed..,4,2025-07-20 05:21:13

"I want to learn, not compete! Constructiveness is NOT the same thing as Competitiveness. Duolingo manages to take the intrigue and curiosity out of learning a new language, and turn it into a frustrating and pressuring experience that left me feeling more discouraged to the point of rage quitting than feeling like I was learning something new from a supportive and interactive platform. If I wanted to play an online game and compete against others, I would just download Candy Crush.",1,2025-07-20 02:40:18
