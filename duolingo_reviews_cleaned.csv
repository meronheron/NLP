"It's good for starters. If you do one lesson a day just to keep your streak, it takes a while to complete a level. It's very repetitive.

And if you do, it reminds you every day. Also, the voice thing never works, and you just lose a life for it. The ads are also annoying.

"Every time they incorporate new AI into the app, it ruins the current learner's progress. The new AI version constantly tests you on words it never taught you. It constantly ""makes changes"" to the lesson plan and jumps your progress forward without actually teaching you any of the new stuff, forcing you to start the whole section over. After the last update, if you say ""I can't listen now"" it counts it as a mistake. I'm almost 1500 days in and the app has become unreliable garbage.",every time incorporate new ai app ruins current learners progress new ai version constantly tests words never taught constantly makes changes lesson plan jumps progress forward without actually teaching new stuff forcing start whole section last update say cant listen counts mistake im almost days app become unreliable garbage

Duolingo provides interesting exercises in a multitude of languages. I sorely regret that Duolingo dropped the chat fora and means for users to provide direct feedback. There it s no personal user support. Also it wouldbe helpful to be able to review exercises after they have been completed..,duolingo provides interesting exercises multitude languages sorely regret duolingo dropped chat fora means users provide direct feedback personal user support also wouldbe helpful able review exercises completed
